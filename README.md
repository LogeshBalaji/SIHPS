### Key Components of the Architecture:  
#### Alumni Web and Mobile Applications:  

##### - Front-end for alumni users to interact with the platform.

##### - Implements OAuth or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
#### User Profiles & Data Storage:

##### - Stores personal and professional information about alumni (including educational background, achievements, contact details, etc.).
##### - Can integrate with external data sources for alumni updates (e.g., LinkedIn API).
##### - Ensures that personal data is securely stored and privacy is maintained.
#### Networking Hub & Job Posting Services:

##### - Promotes networking and collaboration opportunities.
#### Feedback & Surveys:

##### - Allows alumni to provide feedback about their experiences with the platform and college.
##### - Enables the association to track user satisfaction and gather suggestions for improvements.
#### Analytics & Reporting Service:

#### Database (SQL/NoSQL):
##### - Stores all the platform's data, including user profiles, job postings, events, success stories, and donation records.
##### - Can utilize a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured data or a NoSQL solution (e.g., MongoDB) for flexible storage.
